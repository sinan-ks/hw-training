The challenges of the current market – struggling to find inventory, especially homes that are priced for both a willing buyer and a willing seller – have only motivated him more. Alex averaged more than $1 million in sales per day in 2021, totaling more than $375 million in volume for his best year to date and cementing his spot as the leading luxury real estate agent in the region. His goal remains the same: to find the perfect home for his clients before it hits the market, so they’re paying fair market price and not more. Being able to track down those before-market and private sales has made all the difference. “If you approach everything with a solutions-based mindset, you succeed,” Alex explained. “There will always be problems. A strong work ethic and knowledge of the market is not a secret. That’s always been the way to succeed in this business.” Notably, he sold two homes in 2021 offered at more than $20 million, including a home in Volk Estates, the prestigious University Park enclave, that set recent records for Park Cities sales. He calls his achievements a collaborative effort, noting that every successful transaction requires multiple parties, from other agents to appraisers, title companies, and the people he works with in sales and marketing at Allie Beth Allman & Associates. “People and relationships are the center of my success,” he said. “Each year – or each quarter – the market could require new strategies, but creating partnerships with people to solve problems will be a constant. That strategy transcends all markets.” A Southern Methodist University graduate, Alex holds a Real Estate Finance degree from the Cox School of Business. He is experienced in high-end home sales, representing both sellers and buyers, while specializing in the Park Cities, Preston Hollow and surrounding neighborhoods. In addition to his ranking as #1 in Dallas and Texas by RealTrends/The Wall Street Journal, Alex has consistently ranked as a D Best Top Producer and Best Realtor each year by D Magazine. He has been a top-producing agent with Allie Beth Allman & Associates for more than a decade. Socially, he is a big sports enthusiast. He plays golf and, as the grandson of three-time Wimbledon champion Fred Perry, he also plays tennis occasionally.","languages":"","office_name":"","office_number":["(214) 521-7355"],"social":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","other_urls":[]},"state":"TX","title":"Agent","website":"https://www.dallasaddress.com/","zipcode":"75219"}

As a result, she has an excellent source of knowledge on the local market, with an incomparable network of contacts and resources that form the foundation of her success in real estate. With a results-based work ethic and commitment to client service, she describes herself as “hyper-focused,” driven by her dedication to reliability, transparency, accessibility, and a strong desire to close business for her clients. Ashley has been frequently recognized for her accomplishments with prestigious industry honors throughout her real estate career. She’s been named top producer at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, as well as top realtor for five years (2014-2018, 2020) by D Magazine. Her professional training includes certification by the GRI (Graduate Realtor Institute) and the ABR (Accredited Buyer Representative), as well as the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing and Historic Home Specialist. “My values are honesty, integrity, and respect for others – all three are important to me and, in my experience, the only way to achieve true success,” she explains. “I like helping, serving people, and making a difference in my home and community. I’m a hard worker, dedicated, compassionate, and adaptable with strong communication skills.” On September 8, 2021, Ashley, and Chris Pyle launched the Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. It was a bold new stroke for the longtime friends and real estate associates. “Chris and I decided to join forces and form our own team at Allie Beth Allman & Associates,” she explains. Ashley calls creating a new team, “an easy decision,” due to the pair’s years of working together at The Haven Group, which Pyle founded in 2007. “We have similar beliefs and culture,” she says. “By pooling our time, experience, and resources we can offer an accelerated top-level service to our treasured clients.” Ashley says she works with a wide range of clients -- from first-time buyers to seasoned sellers. She enjoys working with clients relocating to Dallas and “showing off our beautiful city,” as she describes it, specializing in the Park Cities, where she lives with her family. She also has a depth of experience in East Dallas, Lake Highlands, Preston Hollow, and Bluffview. Brand differentiation is important to Ashley. “My top-notch customer service and passion for the ‘importance of home’ fortifies a deeply held belief that the process of buying and selling is a vital, intimate, and emotional one that requires thorough, honest, and steady advice … every step of the way.” And it is that differentiation that drives her real estate acumen. At the top of her list is a devotion to quality customer service delivered in her signature calm, personable, and positive style. “Past clients have shared that they appreciate my exceptional customer service, negotiation and problem-solving skills, as well as my patience, and staying involved during, and after the transaction.” A Shreveport, LA native, Ashley has been married for 25 years to Paul Rasmussen, Senior Minister at Highland Park United Methodist Church. The couple are parents to three children: PJ is a senior at The University of Texas-Austin; Arden, a sophomore, also at The University of Texas-Austin; and Luke, who is a junior at Shelton School in Dallas. Beyond a deep knowledge of various local communities, another of Ashley’s greatest strengths, she says, is understanding area school districts. “For one reason or another, early on our three children ended up in different school systems,” she explains. “When it comes to education – private vs. public, and so on -- I bring a wealth of information to clients.” Ashley received her bachelor’s degree in Business Administration at Northwestern State University as well as a master’s degree in Health Promotion. She is dedicated to her community and active with organizations including VNA Meals on Wheels, YMSL, Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center, Family Legacy, and various activities at HPUMC. In her spare time, Ashley enjoys traveling (especially summertime trips to the mountains), reading, cooking, exercising, Bible studies, and most of all, “spending time with my family.”","languages":"","office_name":"","office_number":["(214) 521-7355"],"social":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","other_urls":[]},"state":"TX","title":"Agent","website":"","zipcode":"75219"}

Carrie is the first to admit that she enjoys industry challenges - or more specifically, overcoming them.   She says that the current market, with its low inventory and fierce competition, energizes her and pushes her to advocate for her Buyers and Sellers in exceptional and unprecedented ways. As the wife of a recently retired BNSF Director, Carrie has first-hand knowledge of corporate relocations, understanding exactly what it’s like to fly into a city for a weekend and make a home selection.  Having done multiple corporate moves herself, she relates to the emotional impact that moving has on families.  She works vigorously to make the house-buying trip educational, productive and as stress-free as possible by utilizing her extensive market knowledge and arsenal of top-notch vendors. Everything Carrie does is purpose-driven.  Her keen eye for detail, balance and scale is a cornerstone when it comes to helping her selling-clients get the results they’re wanting - a quick, top-dollar sale.  Whether  she’s assisting Sellers with preparing their homes for the market or helping Buyers write the winning offer, Carrie has the experience, the skill sets and negotiating moxie to provide her clients with the ultimate real estate experience.   Her previous careers in furniture, lighting and building have parlayed perfectly into a career where she’s recognized as a Top Producing Realtor, marketing and selling homes in excess of six million dollars. When she isn’t working, Carrie enjoys traveling and exploring great food and red wines.  She is a voracious reader with a goal to one day publish a novel she began writing several years ago.  Carrie is a strong supporter of organizations that provide food, clothing and shelter to those in need.","languages":"","office_name":"","office_number":["(817) 697-4900"],"social":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","other_urls":[]},"state":"TX","title":"Agent","website":"","zipcode":"76092"}

A native Texan, Chris is passionate about his work. He says he enjoys the fact that real estate is so topical and routinely comes up in discussions beyond the workplace. “It’s an important element in any community fabric – being an expert in real estate makes me better connected to my community and provides a continual incentive for me to help others.” Chris’s methodology for success is simple: “For me, it's a full-time, seven-day-a-week process. From the time I awaken to late hours, I’m focused on all my current transactions and listings, as well as prospects.” His schedule varies daily, even on an hourly basis, depending on the client’s needs. “One of my trade secrets is that I’m a chronic list-maker, which keeps me accountable throughout the day,” he smiles. He credits a devotion to consistent availability and dependability as the keys to his professionalism. “I’m resourceful and will find solutions to any issue real estate related,” he adds The Park Cities and surrounding areas, Preston Hollow, Lakewood/East Dallas, Uptown/Downtown are all areas Chris knows intimately. “Live where you work, as I like to say,” he explains. “I also enjoy working with an even mix of buyers and sellers since I have significant expertise on both sides of the transaction.” As far as specific real estate “superpowers,” Chris has substantial skills as a successful negotiator, which is at the top of his list. “Due to years of marketing experience, I have a clear understanding of what it takes to bring a home to market and maximize an owner’s exposure,” he says. Understanding all areas of Dallas and its distinctive regionalism is key when it comes to guiding buyers through such an important life decision. “I also have a successful track record of handling stressful situations in a calm, productive fashion, which is a valuable service to my clients,” says Chris. As a senior vice president at Allie Beth Allman & Associates, Chris founded The Haven Group in 2007, which he successfully ran for many years. Then, on September 8, 2021, Chris and longtime Haven colleague Ashley Rasmussen took a bold new step when they formed The Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. He says the pair had discussed building the partnership over several years. But when they finally made it official, “It just made good sense.” “Our new team is a partnership in which both of our names are prominent. In my two decades in real estate, it marks the first time to put my name on a brand. And I am proud to do this with Ashley.” He points to the pair’s similar styles, particularly when it comes to thoughtfully guiding buyers to the right decision. “Whether that is advertising, data analysis, or savvy marketing, in the process of the transaction or listing, our mission is to always put the client first,” Chris explains. “For Ashley and me, we’re not interested in growing beyond our bandwidth. We’re dedicated to making sure we are personally handling all our clients,” an attention to detail that is a defining hallmark of The Rasmussen + Pyle Real Estate Group. Geographic proximity is another important element for the team: “I live in Preston Hollow, and Ashley’s in the Park Cities, thus we cover a lot of ground in terms of direct product knowledge.”","languages":"","office_name":"","office_number":["(214) 521-7355"],"social":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","other_urls":[]},"state":"TX","title":"Agent","website":"","zipcode":"75219"}

Frank and his wife, Jane have been Park Cities residents for the last 30 years and have two children. I know there are many choices for Buyers and Sellers when choosing an agent. I am always so pleased when someone hires me to represent them and I do my best to insure that their expectations are not only met, but exceeded. The majority of Frank's sales are repeat clients and referrals. He considers it the highest compliment when a past client endorses him to their friends and family.

Situations that initially seemed like the worst possible outcomes almost always turned out to be far from it. A few years ago, a birthday lunch and a long conversation with a very close friend led to my current role in real estate. I didn’t go to lunch that day with a new adventure in mind, but I left with a renewed sense of purpose and excitement, deciding to build on my long career in sales—this time in the world of actual “bricks-and-mortar” instead of fashion. As a young woman, sheer luck brought me to an entry-level job in retail, where my inquisitive and determined spirit helped me advance through the ranks at Dallas’ beloved Neiman Marcus. I managed several full-line stores, led the start-up of NeimanMarcus.com, and eventually ran the 28-store Last Call division. Inspired by many mentors over the years, I developed a true entrepreneurial spirit within a very large and successful company. My time in real estate has allowed me to build on that foundation and continue doing what I really love: connecting with people. Building a network, paying attention to detail, and finding positive outcomes for clients keeps me going every day. I have served on the boards of numerous non-profit and professional organizations, as well as on the Board of my HOA. I've also been involved in many charitable fundraising projects and have been a featured speaker at several retail symposiums and university lecture series. I am a proud 7th-generation Texan. While at Neiman Marcus, I met my wonderful husband Roger when he called on me to sell advertising. He got the sale, and I got him.","languages":"","office_name":"","office_number":["(214) 521-7355"],"social":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gayletremblay/","facebook":"","twitter":"","other_urls":[]},"state":"TX","title":"Agent","website":"","zipcode":"75219"}

You really want someone who feels like a friend, a protector, marketer, negotiator and collaborator. After spending twenty plus years as a broadcast anchor/reporter and owning my own interior design firm, I am proud to have earned my real estate license. I am a new agent who brings enthusiasm to the market along with my well-honed skills as a communicator, storyteller, renovator and designer. I’m especially humbled to work with Allie Beth Allman and Associates and with Susan Baldwin of the Baldwin Group, a longtime top producing team. I bring to the team a fierce loyalty to our clients; the willingness to work hard; and the energy to find solutions when met with unique obstacles. As a longtime real estate investor in Dallas, I have extensive knowledge of the Dallas market having lived in Lake Highlands, Highland Park, Bluffview and University Park. Given my zip code history, I feel very connected to how emotional and exciting the search for the perfect home and neighborhood can be; I also know first hand the challenges of getting a home ready for sale. However, my family has always had an ally to help us conquer any real estate obstacle: a good realtor. Clearly, my family and I are not afraid of the moving process, but that doesn’t mean we haven’t experienced the stress and strain that can go along with buying and selling a home. One noted move was during the sweltering month of August while I was nine months pregnant and had a toddler and three dogs in tow. It seemed impossible, but with the help of our realtor, we made it work. We were also met with unique challenges while holding three properties during the housing market crash in 2008. Through good advice and faith that the market would rebound, we were able to profit through leasing and holding onto our investments. Historically, real estate has always brought my family financial security and assurance. I never tire of searching for the perfect home and making a space our own. In addition to my love of house hunting and negotiating, I also thrive on deadlines and have a proven track record of finding calm and clarity during chaos. I love meeting new people and discovering their stories. Plus, I firmly believe that buying or selling a home can be a wonderful experience and an absolute joy. I would be honored to help you create your favorite story in your next home.

John initially moved to North Texas to work in the field of commercial real estate. An interest in corporate negotiations and lending led him to the private mortgage insurance industry where he traveled extensively across the country opening local offices and negotiating commercial leases. His extensive background in the often spirited world of commercial lending and contract negotiation coupled with his breadth of experience working closely with high net worth donors in international settings from South Africa to Dubai provided the springboard for his career in residential real estate. Most recently, John served as Executive Director of the Dallas-based Wilson Foundation, the private family foundation of the interior and architectural design firm Wilson Associates, founded by Park Cities native Tricia Wilson. Charged with developing the foundation’s financial capacity to support its educational and health initiatives in the developing world, John’s work frequently intersected with the elite clientele to which Wilson Associates catered. He witnessed first-hand the beauty of creating well-appointed spaces for luxury hotels, casinos and private residences. Today, his application of the detail-oriented nature of those huge deals to residential transactions provides a superior level of service to his real estate clients. A master negotiator and networker, John took every opportunity to meet with lead designers, architects and key decision-makers to familiarize himself with the projects and project leaders who made each design project possible, helping him develop a keen appreciation for luxury finishes and high-end interior design in international settings. During his tenure with Wilson, John increased the foundation’s corpus by 120 percent. His extensive experience working with high net worth individuals in a variety of cultural settings prepared him for the delicate and commanding world of luxury residential real estate. John brings his deep roots in the Dallas area and particularly the Park Cities to the Haven Group and the Allie Beth Allman & Associates team. As a resident of the Park Cities, he has a deep appreciation for the charming neighborhoods, beautiful architecture and high-quality educational opportunities that draw people to the area. He moved to Allie Beth Allman to provide an even higher level of service to his ever-growing luxury client base. With a passion for helping and serving others, John strives to provide a reassuring presence to his clients during every aspect of the transaction.

His unique background informs a professional perspective that allows him to help clients navigate real estate transactions and the business implications of those deals. His real estate roots date to the 1980s in Dallas where he worked summers as a surveyor's assistant for a civil engineering company. He earned a bachelor's degree in business with a major in real estate from the University of Houston and began his career selling shopping centers, triple-net-sale leasebacks, and 1031 exchanges. Always a student of the trade, John's formal education was later enhanced with a graduate degree in real estate from the University of Texas at Arlington. In the early 1990s, John accepted the position of president for a janitorial services company and subsequently grew the business to more than 1,100 employees serving 14 states. By the time he exited the business in 2007, the firm had experienced tenfold topline revenue growth. John then partnered with one of North America's largest childcare companies and led M&A efforts resulting in acquisitions throughout Canada valued at more than $60 million. Upon the successful conclusion of this project, John turned his business interests to the healthcare industry, forming a partnership that acquired and managed a home health, therapy, and hospice organization. Today, John is actively engaged with a successful real estate team, the Wynne Moore Group. He is well suited for the task given his extensive background in client relations, business development and management. John is a member of the World Presidents' Organization (WPO) and has served as a board member for both (WPO) and the North Texas Chapter of the Young Presidents' Organization (YPO). He also serves on the board of directors for Dashfly Technologies, a global mapping software firm.

She evolved her real estate expertise as Dallas itself grew and developed -- acquiring unique niches of specialization and portfolio of cumulative market knowledge that makes her an invaluable advisor to new as well as longtime clients and their families. In addition to traditional single family residential, Karen has diverse areas of experience and expertise that includes condominiums, high-rises, townhomes, investment properties, ranches and even international properties. On the developer side, she created full marketing plans and led on-site sales for Wellington on the Creek, a single family home development in Bluffview and Portobello by the Creek, luxury townhomes in West Village, selling each of these master planned communities ahead of projections. That experience gave her a better understanding of construction, design and staging that has helped her guide her clients every day since. Karen is well-networked and well-respected within the real estate, legal and financing community, an invaluable asset for buyers and sellers who benefit from her insider knowledge, longtime relationships and instant rapport with industry colleagues who come into play in each unique transaction. From expertly staging each photograph to perfection for a new listing to preparing winning contracts for her buyers, Karen throws the full force of her energy and creativity into developing a vision for each client. That is a big part of Karen's formula for success in the fast-moving Dallas real estate market. This multimillion-dollar producer works hard and doesn't stop. When she is not guiding real estate transactions, she is giving back to the city she loves through her participation as a member of the Board of Nexus Recovery Center for Women and as founder of their highly successful fundraising gala, A Night for Nexus. She is also the founding member of one of Dallas most successful Business Networking International groups situated in The Tower Club. She also enjoys cheering on the Highland Park football team, where her grandson was a standout, or visiting a movie set to watch her actress granddaughter Tatiana or exploring the contemporary art scene.","languages":"","office_name":"","office_number":["(214) 521-7355"],"social":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","other_urls":[]},"state":"TX","title":"Agent","website":"","zipcode":"75219"}

The diverse qualities of Mike’s career provide for numerous strengths as a real estate agent. His experience as a general contractor, a deep understanding of the mechanics of homes, and direct access to skilled repair and craftspeople, plus an eye for detail, and knowledge about senior living issues provide tangible advantages to clients. He wakes up every morning determined to serve, which, he says, often means assisting with maintenance challenges and property issues that arise long after the sale. He joined Allie Beth Allman & Associates Real Estate in November of 2021 because he wanted to be a part of a quality team, one that enjoys the admiration of clients as well as competitors, recognized as the area’s premier brokerage.

He specializes in a number of important areas including market knowledge and analysis, high-touch client service, and a depth of expertise in renovation, construction, and project management. He joined Allie Beth Allman & Associates in January 2021, moving from a Dallas boutique brokerage, Clay Stapp + Company, where he worked for over four year as a real estate agent. During his time with Stapp, Raul earned a solid reputation as a hands-on, customer-focused expert, with a distinguished record. In 2016 he was named the company’s Rookie of the Year. Raul ranked among the firm’s top three producers twice and was Stapp’s number one producer in 2020. Making the move to Allie Beth Allman & Associates was “logical,” he says, pointing to the company’s well-established strength in local zip codes where he’s experienced solid business growth. Raul describes himself as “data-driven,” someone who spends a significant volume of time gathering statistics on each neighborhood to clearly understand agents, builders, and the market. During his career, he has also been an exclusive investor in new luxury homes in some of the hottest neighborhoods in Dallas. Raul also owns and manages a portfolio of properties, which he believes has contributed to his concentration of knowledge on everything from business processes to the development of a circle of trusted local-subcontractors, and other essential services needed when buying or selling a home. Having spent years living in Dallas, the Mexico City native knows the entire region well. Raul first came to Texas in 2005 to attend Southern Methodist University. He graduated with majors in Advertising as well as Markets & Culture. Raul’s college experience in the heart of the Park Cities helped him establish close personal and professional connections in the local market where he’s worked since finishing college. Always an avid learner, Raul takes pride in constantly honing his business skills. He closely follows consumer trends and buying-habits, all designed to assist his clients, and is fluent in English and Spanish, a bonus for international clients. Going the extra mile is an important trademark, something he brings to his clients, who have described his work as “beyond the call of duty,” “first-class all the way,” and “an incredible asset”. Raul’s “critical eye,” as described by a recent buyer, and an intimate understanding of the building process, materials, and the costs involved, he believes is rare and an invaluable asset for his clients. But Raul’s greatest skill is his client-oriented service, carefully covering every base for buyers and sellers. “My client’s financial health is a priority,” he explains. In fact, his overarching business mantra is completely centered on the client, their needs, and what’s best for them. As for the foundation of his success, Raul credits his parents who told him to make sure he’s always loyal, diligent, respectful, grateful, and above all, to “never stop learning.”","languages":"","office_name":"","office_number":["(214) 521-7355"],"social":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","other_urls":[]},"state":"TX","title":"Agent","website":"","zipcode":"75219"}

Primarily specializing in University Park, Highland Park, Southlake, Westlake, North Dallas, Preston Hollow, Devonshire, Bluffview, Lakewood, Uptown, the gorgeous Dallas High Rises and the newer developments in the areas of Plano, Frisco, McKinney & Parker all depending on what my clients need and prefer.

A home is everything. Life happens in a home. It's where hopes and dreams are born. My strong team of several agents and coordinators has a keen ability to coordinate all of the details of today’s sophisticated buying transactions from finding that perfect home, negotiating the transaction, arranging the financing, inspecting the property and successfully closing to selling including the staging, pricing and marketing in order to get the best price in the least amount of time.  Strong, personal relationships with other REALTORS, Luxury Portfolio International and the excellent knowledge of the Metroplex expands available real estate offerings through powerful local and global resources to give you the best options and choices.
