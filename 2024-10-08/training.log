1. A meeting was conducted, and our doubts were cleared.

2. Development Site Code Progress:

   - Since I couldn't obtain profile URLs directly from the site, I extracted them from the sitemap 
     using regex.
   - The crawler code has been completed, successfully fetching all profile URLs of agents.
   - The parser code is also completed, extracting all the required fields from the profile pages and saving the output to MongoDB.
   - The code has been split into the following files:
         - crawler.py: Handles the web crawling process to fetch URLs.
         - parser.py: Extracts data from the fetched profile pages.
         - settings.py: Contains common configurations such as headers and URLs.
         - pipelines.py: Manages data storage processes, including saving to MongoDB.

3. Task Status:

   - The parser code output is in progress. 
   - The export.py file to export the output in JSON format, excluding the MongoDB ID field and 
     ensuring the fields are in the specified order, is pending.
