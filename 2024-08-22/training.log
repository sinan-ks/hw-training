1. Continued working on yesterday's Employee Tracking system program and completed it.

 - Employee Task Tracker
    a) This Python application tracks employee working hours and tasks. 
       Each day, an employee logs in, starts and ends tasks, and logs out. 
    b) The task details are saved in a daily JSON file.
