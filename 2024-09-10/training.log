1. I updated my parser program by incorporating headers, including user agents. 
   I successfully obtained the output and saved it to MongoDB.

2. A new task was assigned on anti-scraping measures and evasion techniques.

3. I covered the following topics:

   - IP Blocking: Websites may block IP addresses with suspicious or excessive requests to prevent scraping.
     Evasion Technique: IP Rotation: Use a pool of IP addresses to distribute requests and avoid triggering IP-based blocks.

   - Headers-Based Blocking: Websites check headers like User-Agent or Referer for inconsistencies.
     Evasion Technique: Header Spoofing: Rotate or randomize request headers to mimic different browsers and avoid detection.

   - Crawling Pattern Detection: Detection is based on unnatural request patterns or speed.
     Evasion Techniques:-
       Request Throttling: Implement delays between requests to mimic human browsing behavior and avoid triggering rate-based blocks.
       Randomized Crawling Patterns: Vary request intervals to avoid detection by pattern recognition systems.

   - CAPTCHA Verification: Users are challenged with CAPTCHA puzzles to prove they are human.
     Evasion Technique: CAPTCHA Bypass: Employ CAPTCHA-solving services or integrate with human-in-the-loop services to handle CAPTCHAs when encountered.

   - JavaScript Validation: Websites use JavaScript challenges to block bots that can't execute scripts.
     Evasion Technique: JavaScript Rendering: Use tools like Puppeteer or Selenium that can execute JavaScript like a real browser.

   - Premium Services (PerimeterX, Distil Networks, reCAPTCHA): Platforms like PerimeterX, Distil Networks, and reCAPTCHA provide advanced bot mitigation 
     and protection services to defend against scraping and automated attacks.
     Evasion Technique: Anti-Scraping Libraries: Use libraries and tools designed to handle and bypass various anti-scraping techniques.
