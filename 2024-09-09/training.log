1. A meeting was conducted with the trainer to discuss browser analysis topics, 
   including how to find headers, user agents, APIs, and how to use the curl command.

2. The trainer suggested updating the previously completed crawler program by incorporating headers.

3. I completed the task by adding headers, including user agents, to the program, 
   successfully obtained the output, and saved it to MongoDB.
