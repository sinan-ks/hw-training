1. A meeting was conducted with the trainer to discuss and clarify our doubts related to earlier tasks on 
   Python packages and Python basics.

2. Given the next task: 
   i) Introduction to Linux: This includes Linux OS and basic commands, package installers, terminal text editors, IDEs, and virtual environments. 
   ii) Redo the previous Scrapy task using requests and parsel, by splitting the crawling and parsing stages into 
       two separate Python files and running the code. 

3. Topics Covered Today:
   
     1. Linux OS and basic commands: Understanding the Linux operating system and practicing fundamental commands such as
