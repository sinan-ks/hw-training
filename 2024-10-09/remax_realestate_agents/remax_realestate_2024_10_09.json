Not long after, Joel also acquired his Contractor's License through the City and County of Boulder, and then purchased his first pieces of land in the area. This is where he began his construction career with Thompson Builders. While working in construction, Joel was actively pursued by a local broker for a top real estate firm at the time, Moore & Co.

Starting her career in 1981, she has worked in both the strong buyer’s market of the 1980’s and the strong seller’s market of the 1990’s and understands what it takes to make transactions happen in both types of markets. Shelley also understands the unique way homes are sold compared to other types of products. According to the multiple listing service, 97% of all real estate sales are co-op sales. This means that different brokers will represent the buyer and seller. Thus, Shelley knows that by maintaining a spotless reputation by treating her competitors with honesty and respect is vital to her business. Her fellow Realtors will want to sell her listings and will accept offers from her buyers. Shelley is hard working and patient. She learned to work hard growing up in Iowa where work ethic was highly valued and as the child of depression era parents. She learned patience prior to entering real estate by working as a Physical Therapist.

Ruotolo’s Personal Mission Statement I will provide the best service possible for every client I represent. I will never tell a client what they want to hear if it’s not reality. I will never enter into a client relationship where I know what is expected of me cannot be done in good faith. I will never enter into an agreement with a seller who is unrealistic in regard to proper pricing. When hired to sell a client’s home, I will always make recommendations that can assist their home’s value or help reduce its marketing time even if it means telling them things that they do not want to hear. I acknowledge that I may periodically lose business because I am truthful with my clients, and my competitors will tell them what they want to hear to temporarily get their business. I will always remember , that to have a winning relationship with my clients, we must always have a mutual goal. I will never lose sight that my honesty, loyalty, understanding and creativity are what make me so very different from the real estate masses. My services will always be made available to the public. I will always utilize a well trained staff to assist me in the complex home selling process. I will prioritize my time so that I am working with people who are either buying or selling real estate. I will always treat all parties honestly and fairly, and I will always promote the best interest of the owner. I will obtain the best for the owner, and I will always disclose to the owner all facts that might affect or influence their decisions. I assure you that during my real estate career, I will always strive for excellence and I make a commitment to forego a portion of my life in exchange for continued education so that I may better serve my clients. I share this with you because I believe it is important for you to know how I feel about the real estate industry, and how I feel about the marketing of your home.

She is known for her direct communication, her vast knowledge of all things Real Estate, and her unwavering commitment to her clients’ best interests. Her clients have said “Virginia is a woman of magical thinking, of tremendous character, strength, and creative force.” Virginia doesn’t exist in traditional boxes. She says, “In 55 years of working in real estate I can honestly tell you, I have never had a day that I did not love. I’ve appreciated the opportunities to help people into their dream homes or to sell their homes with the best experience possible. As a Broker/Owner for almost 30 years I helped agents grow their own businesses with integrity and grit. Making magic for others has always been my mission.” Today, having sold her franchise to people who have honored and continued her legacy, Virginia gets to do what she loves best - focus on her clients and work alongside her daughter Carrie Klein Perkins. The duo combine their unique energy and diverse skill sets to form a well-rounded, highly experienced team with more than $500 million in lifetime sales. They are consistently ranked among the top performing luxury teams in Connecticut. In the last 30+ years, they have had the remarkable privilege of representing nearly one thousand clients with their real estate needs. The Klein family name carries a stellar reputation in Fairfield County real estate and will continue to be a shining example in the field. Working tirelessly for her clients continues to excite and fulfill Virginia every day. Clients lucky enough to have her representing them will find her efficient, kind, and unforgettable.

It was the first RE/MAX franchise in NH. In September of 2018 RE/MAX Properties with offices in Nashua, Hollis and Pelham, NH, merged with RE/MAX Innovative to form a new Company known as RE/MAX Innovative Properties. After the merger I became the Managing Broker of the Nashua office which continued until 9/1/2021. I am currently a licensed Broker engaged in listing and selling real estate in NH as well as MA. My strengths include diplomacy, negotiation skills, years of real estate sales and management experience, availability and quick response time and a good sense of humor. My weaknesses are Chinese and Italian food and a good Ribeye. I can help with just about any real estate need you may have from SF homes and condos to commercial property, investment property or raw land for development. Outside interests include all spectator sports, particularly football, hockey and baseball. I am also a golf fanatic. I enjoy traveling, winters in Florida, spending quality time with my grandchildren and family, all types of animals and movie watching. I have been a Rotarian for over 38 years and was President of Nashua Rotary West in 2003-2004. I have also been very active in my local Board of Realtors and served as president of GMNBR in 2012.

I have been a part of at least 4 major market cycles and have witnessed almost every possible real estate scenario you can imagine. Therefore I am confident that whatever situation arises I will have the knowledge and foresight to advise my clients of what is in their best interests when various decisions need to be made. When it comes to working with Sellers I will always make sure that their property is properly marketed. This includes professional photographs, drone shots, 360 degree virtual tours with inter-active remote viewing capabilities, 3D models, floor plans with measurements, top quality yard signs, just listed post cards to the neighborhood and photo ads with corresponding open houses if desired. When it comes to working with Buyers I am very accessable so that if any hot properties come on the market my clients will not miss out on the opportunity to possibly make an offer. Once an offer is accepted I make sure that the financing and home inspection process is properly overseen so that nothing is left to chance.

After marrying the love of my life, Patti, 42 years ago, we moved to our Bucks County home and had the pleasure of raising four beautiful and talented daughters who are now accomplished young woman.

The real estate market was very different in those days and very few new agents kept afloat. These years became the turning point of Diane’s life. In 1989 Diane joined the RE/MAX family. RE/MAX was known as the local office to only accept full time, experienced agents and she was elated to be part of their organization. Diane knew that surrounding herself with experienced, knowledgeable agents would be a benefit and she would learn even more and be able to assist her clients with the highest level of professionalism. Since these days, Diane has grown her business tremendously and is the recipient of many Board of Realtor and RE/MAX awards. The majority of her business is by referral and Diane has enjoyed working with multi generations of families. First time buyers, move up buyers, corporate relocation, investors and empty nesters.

As a seller, they will receive the best possible price in the shortest amount of time, allowing for the change in their life that you have been eagerly awaiting. In both cases, everyone gets what they anticipate. A boring, uneventful settlement is what everyone wants. It means that there are not any unresolved issues to be addressed in the eleventh hour. A calm and pleasant settlement is always possible, if the little details are thoroughly dealt with as they arise. All the “t’s” get crossed and all “i’s” get dotted. Nothing is left for interpretation. Everyone knows what to expect and when to expect it. I want my buyers to owe a bit less than anticipated, and my sellers, receive a bit more than expected. When my clients are in social settings where someone mentions “real estate,” I want them to join the conversation and insist that the person gives me a call. In their minds, they would never consider using anyone other than Dan Thiewes. Taken individually or as a whole, the testimonials on my site, www.DanInTheSand.com, will give you a great feel for the type of care and attention that you will receive if you elect to use my services. If my past clients are describing the type of realtor that you would like to have on your side of the table during the buying or selling process, pick up the phone and give me a call. The thought of buying perhaps the largest item in your life, or selling the house that you have called home for years, can be overwhelming. Make sure that you have someone at your side, someone who is watching out for your best interests every step of the way.

Yet, my heart yearned for a return to my true passion – listing and selling properties, particularly helping individuals and families realize their mountain dream. Witnessing the fulfillment in their eyes as they embark on their own mountain adventure is an indescribable joy that fuels my unwavering dedication. In the words of an adage I hold dear, \"If you are lucky enough to be in the mountains, you're lucky enough.\" This sentiment encapsulates the profound appreciation I have for this awe-inspiring environment. I firmly believe that the mountains possess a magnetic charm that enriches lives and imparts a sense of gratitude and contentment. Allow me to deliver an exceptional real estate experience as I guide you through the intricacies of buying or selling a property in the mountains. With a wealth of knowledge, an unwavering commitment to client satisfaction, and a deep understanding of the unique nuances of this remarkable region, I am poised to make your mountain dreams a reality. #dorindadelivers", "languages": ["English"], "image_url": "https://papiphotos.remax-im.com/Person/100002779/MainPhoto_cropped/MainPhoto_cropped.jpg", "address": "96 Craig St  Ste 111", "city": "Ellijay", "state": "GA", "country": "United States", "zipcode": "30540", "office_phone_numbers": ["(706) 889-4082"], "agent_phone_numbers": ["(706) 889-4082"], "email": "dorindaburnett@remax.net", "website": "https://www.buygamountains.com/", "social": {"linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dorinda-burnett/a/76b/87", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/dorindacb", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/buygamountains", "other_urls": []}, "profile_url": "https://www.remax.com/real-estate-agents/dorinda-burnett-ellijay-ga/100002779"}

I’ve been successful in that endeavor by receiving the Five Star Professional Award (2012-2020) by Portland Monthly Magazine for providing my clients “outstanding service and customer satisfaction” as a result of research conducted by contacting consumers directly. I attribute this award to my philosophy that guides my business: “Make people happy.” How? Follow up. Do what you say you are going to do. Keep in contact with clients throughout the process. Whatever the situation, be honest with folks about the potential benefits and pitfalls associated with any decision they may make during a sale or a purchase. If I continue to do these things I know my clients will be happy, and it’s worked so far. My roots run deep in the Portland area. My great grandfather emigrated from Finland and landed in the Sullivan’s Gulch neighborhood in about 1899. I was born and raised in the Portland, Oregon area, having lived both in the city and the ‘burbs, east side and west side.

Lee grew up in a real estate family, learning the business from the ground up rehabbing properties. After honing his skills as a top producing Realtor, closing in excess of 2000 transactions, he began learning the management side of running a Brokerage. Working alongside his brother Kevin Acker, they completed Broker management training, while being mentored by their father, until they took over the helm of managing the REMAX offices in 2005. The following years were some of the most challenging as they lost their father and mother while piloting their companies through the “Great Recession” and recovery. They not only survived this time but they continued to grow their REMAX offices with quality agents and staff. They also established their own title company, Leading Edge Title which has multiple locations from Tampa to Daytona. In 2019 they added their third REMAX office, RE/MAX Exclusive Collection, a boutique firm in College Park serving the fine homes and luxury properties of the surrounding areas while focusing on new construction and investment properties. Lee is the father of two successful daughters, one young puppy and is husband to a very patient wife who just happens to also be an International REMAX Agent. When asked what he appreciates most, Lee said: “I treasure my blessings of family, associates, and supportive staff. These relationships make our companies strong and successful. It is an honor that our teams trust us so much that their sons and daughters are now building their future lives with our companies.

My truth and course in life is to serve. What I do for my clients is important, but it is how I do it that makes a difference in their lives. I love my work because I serve my clients in a way that leaves them enriched and happy. That may sound goofy, but in the practical world, shepherding people through the complicated and high-stakes process that is likely the largest financial decision in their lives is vital work.

Born and raised in Texas, I relocated to Wisconsin in 1998 during my previous corporate career and understand the stress of relocating having done it four times across state lines. I decided to pursue a career in real estate shortly after moving to Wisconsin, as I realized I enjoyed the process of buying and selling a home more than the job that was causing me to relocate. Being a Realtor since 1998, I thoroughly know the metro Milwaukee and surrounding area. I personally work with all my buyers and sellers from start to finish, as I've purposely decided to not add buyer agents and listing coordinators to my business -- I value the relationships established working with each client. I make use of the latest technology to keep clients informed on a daily basis of new properties on the market or listing activities for sellers. You will always deal directly with me when it comes to your transaction. I feel fortunate in that I love what I do, and don't consider this a \"job\" but helping people find the right house to call home, or making the selling process as stress-free and easy as possible. I have proven experience having sold over 600 homes and over $168 million in volume since 1998. Outside of real estate, I love spending time at the lake (we have many beautiful lakes to enjoy in SE Wisconsin by the way!) and cheering my kids on at baseball, basketball, and volleyball games. I live with my husband and two kids in Elm Grove, a suburb 10 minutes west of Milwaukee. I look forward to hearing from you, or taking great care of your referral.

Over 36 years in the industry, I have adapted to significant changes while continuing to achieve the best results for my clients. My base of knowledge extends beyond assisting residential buyers and sellers; more and more, I work with clients who aim to invest in real estate. No matter the goal, I strive to give everyone who works with me the best care, as I truly enjoy Real Estate and the opportunity to meet new people. On a few occasions, I have been lucky enough to help families transition into new homes at multiple points in their lives. When I am able to bring them deep satisfaction as they make a truly- life changing choice. I feel that I have done my job. Thanks for your interest!

I have 36 years of experience in the business: I spent 27 years selling real estate on the east coast, and have been an East Bay resident for the past 9 years. I have developed a knack for settling quickly in new places, as I immigrated to America 44 years ago from India. I came with an openness to understanding a new culture and a keen desire to serve others. I have made good on these values in my work: my clients can let go of their anxieties around buying and selling, and rest assured that I will work my hardest to make the process a pleasure for them. Specifically I can give extensive help to buyers with financing or finding their ideal homes at the right price. With sellers I provide detailed market analysis and competitive pricing according to the current market.

RE/MAX has awarded her the Lifetime Achievement Award and put her in the company’s Hall of Fame.

If they have a crazy idea, I do my best to help them accomplish it if it's really something they decide they want,” she says. “I'm always there when they need me and do everything I can to meet their schedules and their needs.” She also prides herself on her honesty. “I tell them the truth,” she says. “I tell them what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. They might not like it at the time, but they know I only have their best interest at heart.” Carpenter says one of her proudest accomplishments of 2019 was helping over 60 families, \"and that's what my business is all about,” she says.

My journey took a significant turn in 1994 when I transitioned full-time into real estate, setting the stage for a rewarding career. In Decatur, AL, my dedication to real estate and the community has been unwavering. I've twice served as the President of the Morgan County Association of REALTORS® in 2007 and 2020 and was honored as the 2009 REALTOR® of the Year. My commitment extends beyond sales; I was the 2018/2019 Chair of ARPAC Trustees, learning firsthand how closely real estate intertwines with politics. Awards like the 2018 Alabama REALTORS® for Children and the 2021 Alabama REALTOR® of the Year underline my passion. However, my commitment doesn’t end with real estate. I am deeply involved in the community through Westminster Presbyterian and organizations like PACT, Mosaic Mentoring, and the Carnegie Visual Arts Center. My efforts were nationally recognized when President George H. W. Bush honored me as the Nation's Volunteer of the Day on April 7, 2006.
