1. A meeting was conducted to discuss and clarify our doubts.

2. A new task was assigned:

   - We need to create a copy of our already saved collection in MongoDB using coding and 
     update that collection with the following fields:

       - currency: Include this field only if there are values in the selling price and regular price.
       - file_name_1 (e.g., 4066447615852_1.png): The file name should be the value of unique_id, 
                      incremented by number according to the image URLs, with the appropriate image URL 
                      extension at the end.
       - image_url_1: This field should contain the image URL and be incremented for each image URL.
       - file_name_2
       - image_url_2
         etc...

   - Additionally, we need to export the updated MongoDB output to JSON.

3. Task Status:

   - Successfully created a copy of the already saved collection using Python code and 
     updated the copied collection with the required fields.
   - Successfully exported the JSON output.
