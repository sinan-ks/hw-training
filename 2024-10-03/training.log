1. - A meeting was conducted where we were taught about payloads, curl_cfii, and cookies 
     when making requests. 
   - We also learned about using POST requests with payloads to get responses and discussed code 
     improvements:

          - Using pipeline.py for MongoDB connection.
          - Storing common fields like headers, payload, cookies, and base_url in settings.py.
          - Moving data cleaning logic to export.py.

2. - We were provided with the following resources for review and understanding:

          - https://pypi.org/project/curl-cffi/
          - https://curl-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/impersonate.html
          - https://pypi.org/project/html-sanitizer/

   - Additionally, we were given the following websites to test responses using payloads, cookies, 
     curl_cfii, and POST requests:

          - https://baity.bh/
          - https://exprealty.com/
          - https://www.interspar.at/

3. Task Status:

   - Yesterday's pending data checking for realtysouth and semonin realtors has been completed, 
     and issues for cleanup have been noted.
   - Checking the provided websites using payloads, curl_cfii, cookies, and POST requests is
